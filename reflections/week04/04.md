## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. 
Simply put, REST is a design pattern for API's that allows the client to see a representation of the state of the requested resource, rather than the actual resource itself. RESTful api's have specific contstraints that enable it to be easier to use, including having a uniform interface, client-server separation, being stateless, having a layered system, being cacheable, and having code-on-demand. 

2. What does Stateless mean?
Stateless means that when a server gets a request, it does not hold onto any identifiable information regarding the client, past or present. 

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?
When writing a RESTful API, we use an endpoint URL. The endpoint URL should contain a domain, port, path, and/or query string.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
One new thing I learned today was that when using the spreader (...)  for the array of gifts, you can swap the existing array and the spreader to change the position that the new object is placed on the page. My partners and I thought that we weren't getting our new gift drawn to the page at all, when in reality it was just being drawn to the bottom of the existing objects, causing us to not realize it was there the whole time.
