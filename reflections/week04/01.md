## Questions

1. What are some of the signs and causes of `Callback Hell`?
One major sign of callback hell is a pyramid of })'s at the end of your code.
Callback hell is caused by writing code in a way that tries to execute the code from start to end of the function, which is typically how different languages work, but that's note quite how Javascript works. 

2. What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?
Asynchronous (async) is a term that signals that the function will not occur immediately, but will happen at some point in the future. When a function has async attached and uses a call back, the function doesn't immediately return a value because it could prevent the rest of your code from running. Instead, the code that needs to run later is stored in a callback.

3. Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix `Callback Hell`

The first way to avoid callback hell is keep your code "shallow". This means to be sure to give your functions names, which helps make code more readable and easier to debug, as well as makes it easier to move things around so that the structure of your code is more organized. 

The second way to avoid callback hell is to modularize your code. This means to create small modules with basic functionality that can be easily added into other modules that have a larger functionality. 

The third way to avoid callback hell is to make sure you handle every single error, especially platform errors. Since callbacks are handling tasks that are running in the background, it's hard to know if errors are happening there. Because of this, it's smart to assume there will be a bug somewhere and put something in your code to help you remember to handle any errors that might occur, using something like a code linter.
