## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?
The 3 states of a promise are pending, resolved, and rejected. Pending is the stage before the promise has succeeded or failed, resolved is when it has been completed successfully, and rejected is when the promise has failed. 

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?
Using promises allows you to chain callbacks rather than pass them, which eliminates callback hell and makes your code more readable. 

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?
'.then()' occurs after a promise has been resolved because it gives instructions on what to do next if the promise is successful. 
On the other hand, '.catch()' only occurs if a promise has been rejected, and if it is, the promise jumps to the catch() method and we will get a different message.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today I was able to fully complete the house section on Gregslist Async and start on the jobs portion (except for getting the see details modal to work since that wasn't as big of a focus today). I ran into a lot of little errors today, but was able to successfully use the debugger on a few instances and the references to help me find my issues. My biggest point of confusion had to do with the GetHouseFormTemplate and how it changed as we added new features like create and edit. One small error that got me stuck for awhile was forgetting to put a / on the end of the api's url when I wanted to attach the id to it in order to delete/edit. I will definitely remember to do that in the future! Another big help was learning that now that we have a few different pages, we don't want any of them to load as soon as the page loads. Instead we want the user to select which category they want. To do this, I had to move the this.getHouses and this.getCars from the constructor to the showHouses() and showCars() functions. I also had to move the _drawHouseForm and _drawCarForm from the constructor to the showHouses() and showCars().
