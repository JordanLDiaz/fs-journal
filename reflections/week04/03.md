## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?
The purpose of Async/Await is built on promises but is a higher level than just promises alone. Ultimately they reduce the boilerplate surrounding promises and make it less likely to break the chain when you are chaining multiple promises using asychronicity. 

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?
In order to use await for a promise in a function, you must flag the function as async and then must use await inside the function. Without both of these pieces, it won't work. 

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?
The primary benefit of using async/await is that it makes your code look far more simple and organized, especially as the code gets more and more complicated. You can also chain multiple async functions in a row, and it makes debugging easier it acts more like synchronous code whereas debugging promises does not step over asynchronous code.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
A struggle from today was naming conventions with all of the different pokemon related files and functions, especially when having two of every major file. I found myself slowling down a lot because I wanted to make sure I kept the names straight as well as the capitalization. Another struggle was identifying the proper paths to access information on the Poke Api, particularly when those paths have a few layers. I know with time and more practice I will get more comfortable digging through the data that the api returns to find what I need. I am also looking forward to getting more comfortable using the Network part of our dev tools to help with debugging and seeing what is happening with the data.
