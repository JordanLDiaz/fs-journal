## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
The purpose of encapsulation is to wrap up similar data and methods into separate files, as well as to prevent the user from accessing certain information depending on where within your JavaScript files you place it, especially any actual data that is stored in the AppState. In MVCS, access is limited to the user within the Controller, Services, AppState, and the Model.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
Some of the problems with the underscore prefix is that it can lead to breaking changes when they are not used consistently by developers. Using the underscore prefix doesn't create the best encapsulation, so it seems like it would be better to use closures and classes to help maintain privacy and limit the users ability to manipulate things they don't need access to. 

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
We can create private variables by including an _ in front of the name of the function. This simply communicates to other developers that might be viewing the form that it is private.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Today started making a little more sense with all of the different js files and their purposes. Watching the videos on MVC at home has really allowed me to spend more time chewing on the new concepts and understanding the roll that each serves. I'm getting more comfortable with switching between files based on this better understanding. A big thing I struggled with today was making sure I link my pages correctly using the intellisense available. I need to remember to tab on everything possible to make sure things get imported/exported properly. I also learned how important it is to make sure the capitalization and and pluralization of things matches in the right spot, otherwise you will get errors.
