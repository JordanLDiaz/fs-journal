## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
The purpose of encapsulation is to wrap up similar data and methods into separate files, as well as to prevent the user from accessing certain information depending on where within your JavaScript files you place it. In MVCS, the data that is limited to the user is within the Controller, Services, AppState, and the Model.

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
