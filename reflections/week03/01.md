## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?
Using exports solves the problem of not being able to include JavaScript files inside other JavaScript files. Before exports were created as part of ES6 Modules, developers had to include multiple script tags within the main file, which made it possible to reference, but slowed down the processing of the page. 

2. How does export differ from export default?
Modules can be exported individually or with a single export statement that includes a reference to each of the named variables. When using regular exports, you can export multiple within the same module. On the other hand, with export default, you can only have one per module. 

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
A major benefit of using the Module System is that you can separate different types of functionality into different files which helps with organization and also makes debugging easier.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

MVC seems very helpful for organizing multiple different javascript files, but also feels very overwhelming at the moment. There was a lot of new info today and a lot to keep track of as we moved through all the different files. I do see why having so many js files is important in regards to the single responsibility principle in SOLID. Each file should have its own job so that infomation is as organized as possible. Doing this also makes it easier to debug as depending on the errors you get, it should be easier to find and solve those bugs despite having so much code throughout all of the documents.
