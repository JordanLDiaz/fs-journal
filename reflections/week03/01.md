## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?
Using exports solves the problem of not being able to include JavaScript files inside other JavaScript files. Before exports were created as part of ES6 Modules, developers had to include multiple script tags within the main file, which made it possible to reference, but slowed down the processing of the page. 

2. How does export differ from export default?
Modules can be exported individually or with a single export statement that includes a reference to each of the named variables. When using regular exports, you can export multiple within the same module. On the other hand, with export default, you can only have one per module. 

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?
A major benefit of using the Module System is that you can separate different types of functionality into different files which helps with organization and also makes debugging easier.
