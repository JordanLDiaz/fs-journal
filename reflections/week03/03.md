## Questions

1. What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?
The two common operations we will set in the handler are get and set. 

2. What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to ensure the value does not become `undefined`?
In order to ensure the value does not become 'undefined', you must provide a 'trap', which is a way to override the way the get operator works by default. 

3. What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

By using proxy objects, we are able to limit the users access to information that they don't need to have access to. This helps create more barriers between users and data, which in turn boosts the security of an application.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
I am feeling more comfortable about the initial steps of setting up all of the different files and making sure they link up. I really enjoyed watching the build of cars for Gregs-list and then continuing the project by building out a new page. It did a good job of scaffolding my understanding and helping me to work through all of the many steps throughout all of the files. I did get stuck on getting the delete button to work, but I plan to continue working on it.
