> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

The observer pattern seeks to solve the problem of ensuring that the many elements and data involved in an application are in sync and to enable one-to-many data binding amongst those elements. 

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The 3 mechanisms of the observer pattern are Subscribe(adds new observable events), Unsubscribe (removes observable events), and Broadcast (executes all events with fixed data).

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

Since we don't want the user to have access to certain information, we use proxy objects to prevent them from accessing data in the appState. By using proxy objects in the controller and service, users are blocked from going through the layers of code and are therefore only able to manipulate data they are given access to in the controller in the form of public functions.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Today's assignment was a challenge as my partner and I struggled to simply get our players names to draw to the page at first, as well as to get our random fruit to show without it saying the name of the fruit attached to "undefined". I am not feeling very confident in my understanding currently.
