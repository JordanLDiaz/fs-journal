## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?
Testing is a way to test the smallest unit of code in order to make sure it functions as intended. Similarly to why we code small, it's also important to test small. Doing so allows you to focus tests on single behaviors within an application so that if a test fails, you know exactly what chunk of code failed. 

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?
Unit testing provides peace of mind and encourages developers to consider as many potential problems as possible. It also gives developers confidence that edge cases are covered and will not be an issue. 

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?
Testing can be time consuming initially when designing the tests, but allows for more efficiency in the long run.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work
Merge conflicts are frustrating, but we tested a lot on small things to make sure it won't be an issue later down the road. I think this initial communication and intention about merge conflicts will allow us to avoid them for the most part.
