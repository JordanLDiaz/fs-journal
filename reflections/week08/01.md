## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
Creating a developer portfolio provides many benefits including showing proof of your expertise, increasing your personal brand, and increasing your visibility within the developer world. 

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
In order to have an effective portfolio, it's best to select 4-6 quality projects of varying sizes. It's also key to pick projects in a variety of languages in order to show flexibility and ability to code in multiple languages. Ultimately it depends on what your goals are with your portfolio and the meaning you give to your projects.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
I would include Mushroom Forager, Inspire, and Tower. I think these three are my most complete and well put together applications that demonstrate my current coding abilities. They also use a variety of languages and demonstrate different types of applications (game, SPA, MPA).
