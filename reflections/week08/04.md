## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
The three types of testing in Vue are unit testing (allows you to test individual units of code in isolation), component testing(gives users the ability to test functions related to Vue), and end-to-end testing (allows developers to validate all layers of their application).

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
E2E seems like it would be the most useful because it allows you to test all areas of your application in an environment that is more similar to what the user will experience. 

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
I am not sure, the others seem equally as good. It really depends on the environment and needs of the developer.
