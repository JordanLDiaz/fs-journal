## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

The main ways to write information to the console are by using print statements and console.log(), 

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

The Elements tab allows you to view and affect HTML/CSS. This is helpful when debugging because you are able to change/add/remove code directly within the dev tools and will see the effects of those changes immediately without affecting your HTML or CSS pages. It's also a great way to play around with the styling of things so that you aren't making changes to your document until you're sure you want to make the change because you saw it work via the elements tab.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

To debug your code, you can also use the Sources tab which allows you to run through parts of your code, like your functions, and view step by step what happens when you invoke it. By watching it step-by-step, you can find the exact point where things go wrong, which should help you to identify the problem and solution more easily.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Getting in the reps by creating functions for every single item that could be purchased in the ice cream parlor was a great way to help me practice and become more comfortable with writing functions and getting them logged to the console. I really struggled with drawing the items to the cart though. I still feel like I can interpret the code decently when its written by others, but identifying and writing it on my own is a challenge. I didn't get as far in today's assignment as I would like and I definitely need more practice. I really need to remember that the debugger exists in the source tag when I get stuck!
