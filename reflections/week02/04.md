## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

Making a plan and mocking out a webpage before starting to write code helps you to visualize where you want different elements and how you want to organize your content. Thinking through how to use bootstrap containers, rows, and columns for your specific project allows you to get the basic structure of your page down more quickly and therefore allows you to get into the functions sooner. 

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

When you're stuck there are lots of ways you can find answers. One important way is Google, but you need to make sure you understand code that might help you solve the problem before actually using it. 
For our program, we are also able to use our references and can ask for help from our teachers and TA's.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

My biggest takeaways from the article are to make sure I plan well before starting to code(but don't over do it), to use my resources when I run into problems, code small and test often, to question existing code and not just assume it's good because it works, to not focus/worry so much about what is best practice, to commit early and often, to view errors as progress and learning opportunities, and to remember to take a lot of breaks.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

Partner coding is a great way to learn how others think through and plan their code. It was fun to try live share today so that my partner and I could work on our project simultaneously while also discussing how we would like to structure things. Javascript is still not fully clicking with my brain and I need a lot of guidance when working out how to write out what I want it to do on the screen. I need to work on chunking down the steps/directions into smaller parts.
