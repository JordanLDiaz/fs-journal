## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
Scope has to do with where a variable is available to use. For example, if a variable is declared outside of a function, it can be used globally. If a variable is only declared within a function, its scope is more limited and is only available for use when the function is declared.

2. What is Hoisting ?
Hoisting is a default behavior in javascript where variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope before code is actually executed. To avoid bugs from hoisting, it's best to simply declare all of your variables at the top of its scope.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Using let allows you to update variables, but not redeclare them, so long as it's within different scopes. For example, if I use let greeting = 'Hello' outside of the scope of declaring a separate function that includes let greeting = 'Hey hi how are ya?', because they are in different scopes, I should not get an error message. On the other hand, if I declared both of those variables within the same scope, I would get an error message. 

A const declaration is similar to a let declaration in that they are also block scoped, but a key difference is that const declarations cannot be redeclared nor updated.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
It was a bit of an adjustment to add Javascript to my HTML/CSS project today. I felt like I stared at my screen for awhile just thinking through how to start, but once I came up with a theme (Harry Potter) and did up a quick low-fidelity wireframe, things became a bit clearer. The biggest struggle for me was making sure my wording was consistent throughout my javascript. I ended up with a lot of errors simply because I would pluralize 'point' without realizing. I also need to make sure I'm consistent with invoking functions and not just defining them. Most of my time spent trouble shooting today was solved by identifying issues like those. Conceptually, the most confusing thing for me was understanding the drawScore() function and why it is written out that way. I also get a weird ? mark added to my drawScore () function, but when I delete it, it gives me an error.
