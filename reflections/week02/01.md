## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
Scope has to do with where a variable is available to use. For example, if a variable is declared outside of a function, it can be used globally. If a variable is only declared within a function, its scope is more limited and is only available for use when the function is declared.

2. What is Hoisting ?
Hoisting is a default behavior in javascript where variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope before code is actually executed. To avoid bugs from hoisting, it's best to simply declare all of your variables at the top of its scope.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Using let allows you to declare the same variable twice, so long as it's within different scopes. For example, if 
I use let greeting = 'Hello' outside of the scope of declaring a separate function that includes let greeting = 'Hey hi how are ya?', because they are in different scopes, I should not get an error message. On the other hand, if I declared both of those variables within the same scope, I would get an error message.
