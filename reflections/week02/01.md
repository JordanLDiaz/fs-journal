## Questions

1. What is Scope ?
Scope has to do with where a variable is available to use. For example, if a variable is declared outside of a function, it can be used globally. If a variable is only declared within a function, its scope is more limited and is only available for use when the function is declared.

2. What is Hoisting ?
Hoisting is a default behavior in javascript where variables and functions are moved to the top of their scope before code is actually executed. To avoid bugs from hoisting, it's best to simply declare all of your variables at the top of its scope.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
Using var allows a variable to be both redeclared and updated, while using let allows you to update variables, but not redeclare them, so long as it's within different scopes. A const declaration on the other hand cannot be redeclared nor updated.

Overall it seems that if you know you have a variable that you want to stay the same throughout your code, you should use const, but if you have a variable that you would like to update at some point in your code, you should use let. Var has the highest risk of letting a variable change when you may not want it to, so I think it would be best to use either let or const depending on the situation.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
It was a bit of an adjustment to add Javascript to my HTML/CSS project today. I felt like I stared at my screen for awhile just thinking through how to start, but once I came up with a theme (Harry Potter) and did up a quick low-fidelity wireframe, things became a bit clearer. The biggest struggle for me was making sure my wording was consistent throughout my javascript. I ended up with a lot of errors simply because I would pluralize 'point' without realizing. I also need to make sure I'm consistent with invoking functions and not just defining them. Most of my time spent trouble shooting today was solved by identifying issues like those. Conceptually, the most confusing thing for me was understanding the drawScore() function and why it is written out that way. I also get a weird ? mark added to my drawScore () function, but when I delete it, it gives me an error.
