## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
We are using a variety of API's such as Open Weather, Unsplash, DadJokes, Poetry, and a Quote Api. We are also working on integrating a calendar feature. 

2. What went well so far?
We have done a good job of communicating as we go through and making sure that we are each still pleased with the direction of the project, even as things start to change more and more as the build continues. 

3. What would you do differently? Why?
Initially it felt like we did a good job of breaking down all of our hopes for the app into smaller chunks/tasks, but as we continued working I realized that we needed to do that even more so for a few portions, such as with our forms for creating goals. It's was hard to fully think through how we wanted everything to look and function until we got to the actual build of those parts. I think that will come with time as we work more in teams to build out full stack applications.
