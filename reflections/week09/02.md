## Questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?
Github actions lets you offload some of the toolings to Github by creating text files within a repository. This is called a workflow. 
The way workflows work is by handling common build tasks so that responds to specific actions to do complete delivery and continuous integration. 

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?
Github actions' benefits are the ability to automate various actions when code is pushed and pulled in Github. Actions also run on many platforms, allowing developers to test their code in many places.

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?
Workflows can use workflow, scheduled, webhooks,and external trigger actions. 
Workflow: responds to specific events within the workflow like push/pull requests.
Scheduled: An action that is scheduled to be done at a specific time.
Webhooks: An action done when someone stars your repository or when a wiki page gets created/edited.
External: An action triggered by something occurring outside of Github, like a repository dispatch event.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work
Today I used bootstrap collapse for our weather component so that on load the user only sees the temperature and weather icon. It wouldn't work for awhile until I realized that the data-toggle and data-target were missing the bs. Collapse worked really well here and was otherwise super simple. I can see many uses for this in the future. 
Another tricky part from today was getting the updateAccount function to persist on reload. We over thought it at first and tried creating a whole new function, but later realized that we just needed to modify the updateAccount function that was already included. Once we figured that out, we realized that we just needed to update the user.id to simply user because we are only dealing with one user rather than multiple.
