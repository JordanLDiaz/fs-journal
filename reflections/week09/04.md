## Questions

1. What is an SSL certificate?
An SSL certificate is a small data fil that establishes an encrypted link between a web server and browser. This link makes sure that the data being passed back and forth remains private and secure. 

2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?
- Extended Validation - Offers a high level of encryption (expensive). Shows the padlock, HTTPS, business name and country in address bar to show user it is secure and not a spam website. 
- Organization Validation - Verifies that an organization/domain validation are real. They offer a medium level of encryption (cheaper than EV) by verifying who owns the domain and if the organization is operating legally. 
- Domain Validation - Offers a low level of encryption (cheapest of the 3) shown by the padlock next to URL. This validation occurs when adding DNS to the CA. This one does not vet identity data. 
- Wildcard - Ensure that if you buy a certificate for one domain, it can also be used for subdomains. 
- Unified Communications - aka multi-domain. These allow multiple domain names to be on the same certificate. Can cover up to 100 domain names. 
- Single Domain - protects only one domain, and does not protect subdomains. 

3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?
Depending on your needs, there are many different types of certificates and various prices/serving various purposes. This means many different kinds of sites should be able to find SSL certificates that fit their needs and offer protection/privacy for their users. Websites that have SSL will likely have better SEO because they are more secure and therefore ranked higher than those without.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work
As you work on a project with a team, the vision can change as you start to dig more and more into how a user will interact with the app. We made a few changes yesterday to our homepage functionality, and today we made some additional changes on our main goal page. I learned that it is ok to adjust design/style as the application progresses because of new ideas/learnings.
