## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?
A Base64 encoded image is an encoding schema used for representing binary data in a text format. It provided a way to work around the need for a queue of requests to the server on image heavy sites. It did this by using an open HTTP connection to deliver images that are already within the html/css.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?
Some drawbacks of using Base64 are that it increases the file size, which increases download time/cost. It also adds an extra layer of decoding, which is unnecessary, and it creates caching issues. Base64 can also damage SEO and your users' experience.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?
Nowadays you should try to avoid using Base64 encoded images altogether due to the reasons listed above, but there are a few edge cases where it might make sense. For example, if your image file string is smaller than the length of the URL string/HTTP request, it would make sense to use it here.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work
Today we struggled to identify/agree on the best way to layout one of our pages, and decided to ask a TA/outside perspective to interact with our app thus far and give feedback on how they would use it as a user. This helped steer us in the right direction and helped us come to a decision as a team on the best way to move forward.
