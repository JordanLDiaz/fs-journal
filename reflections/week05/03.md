## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?
Timeboxing is simply preplanning the completion of a task by identifying a specific amount of time that the task should be completed within. The time frame is essentially setting a boundary/deadline to be met in order to keep you moving and not get stuck on a specific task for too long. Doing this helps devs to be more intentional with their use of time by maximizing their productivity in relation to time and limiting procrastination. 

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
"...Focus on success, rather than perfection," -Rulken

 a. Strategically Quitting
 b. Practice and Adapt
 c. Be Flexible and Prioritize


3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how?
Timeboxing would have helped me immensely when completing some of my checkpoints where I found myself focusing on styling more than necessary, especially at the start of a project. Focusing on getting things more or less just right at the start can lead to hours of playing with styling, even when the rest of the app isn't functional. Styling can be a great way to procrastinate on other seemingly more difficult tasks, but I want to use my awareness of timeboxing to change this mentality so that I can make better use of my time. Moving to back-end dev is helping me understand this even more as we don't have to worry about the front-end, and therefore we are not worrying about styling.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Many to many relationships are much more complicated to work with. Thinking through the relationships and making sure to link correctly was challenging today and slowed me down a bit. I really want to get more practice with many to many because that is definitely where I start to get lost while coding.
