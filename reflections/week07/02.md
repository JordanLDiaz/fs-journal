Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Today we finished our full stack lecture and got our Tower checkpoint. Lots of takeaways, but I particularly want to remember to make sure I make extra sure that my set up in vscode and postman are good and complete before even worrying about coding. We did this by setting up both env files, running BOTH server and client, gathering 2 auth tokens for postman, and running our first get request on events in order to see that our user account is connected before posting an event. We learned how to get 2 auth bearer tokens for postman so that we can better handle invalid requests from users who may be trying to be malicious with their use of our application.
