## Questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
Pair programming is when you work with a partner not only on the same project, but also on the same computer, swapping coding turns every so often, and actively discussing the code. The roles are the driver, the one that is typing, and the navigator, who focuses more on the overall direction. 

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
- Increased code quality due to voicing coding thought processes while working.
- Diffusion of knowledge and ability to make up for others weaknesses in certain areas.
- Better able to coordinate code.
- When work is interrupted for one, the other is able to continue working, allowing progress on the project to continue.

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
- If both programmers are not actively involved, it's not beneficial.
- Lack of communication can be detrimental.
- Relationship issues can make it challenging.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
No lab - worked on back-end of Post-It.

In today's lecture we learned how to perform tests in postman as you send requests to databases in order to ensure that everything is communicating and you are truly getting the data you are requesting. No more hoping it's working just because we see an empty array!
