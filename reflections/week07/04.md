## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
We did not do a partner project this week because we had checkpoint 6 during the week. I did try to use better code documentation, especially when naming my functions this week.  

2. What went well this week?
I started really strong working through the backend, and am feeling pretty confident overall in this area. I'm becoming more comfortable with Postman tests. I feel that I generally timeboxed well and sought help when needed. 

3. What would you do differently?
I would take more breaks throughout the day.
