## Questions

1. What is Component based architecture?
Component based architecture is, "a method for encapsulating individual pieces of a larger user interface into self-sustaining independent micro-system." (Shapiro, 2016). 

2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
Some benefits of component based architecture are that because all of the components are indepdent of the others, developers can have many different moving parts in their UI. Since each component has its own interface, it can be updated without affecting the other components and without a refresh. This helps save developers time when debugging. Components are also reusable which further builds on the independence of all the components in an application. 

3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture? 
Some drawbacks to component based architecture are that when you have so many different components, readability can be affected. Additionally, the over used of CBA can cause developers to over-engineer their projects.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
The reactivity included in Vue is very cool and I'm excited to become more proficient in it to help build applications faster and more efficiently. There are definitely a lot of new ways to write things, but I think as I continue to practice, it will continue to make more sense. I want to remember that a lot of the concepts are very similar to vanilla js, but the formatting is just different.
