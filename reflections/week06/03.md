## Questions

1. What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for?
Lifecycle hooks let you see when a component has been created, addede to the DOM, updated, or deleted. Creation hooks allow you to perform actions before a component is added to the DOM, and they are used when you want to set things up in your component.

2. How have you utilized lifecycle hooks in your afternoon projects?
We have used onMounted in our afternoon projects, which signals what should appear on load/refresh. 

3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
Mounting hooks let you access your components upon the first render, so if you need access to that component right away, you would use one.
