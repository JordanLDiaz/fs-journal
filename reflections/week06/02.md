## Questions

1. What are props?
Using props helps us to pass variables/other info between different components (e.g. parent and child components). This is similar to how we pass variables into functions as arguments in js. 

2. What are props used for?
Props are used to pass data DOWN the component tree, from parent to child, but not up the tree. 

3. Where can props be used or accessed?
Props can be accessed within components inside the export default{} , but above the setup().

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
As our application grows and grows, it becomes necessary to chunk it apart by its individual components. Thinking about new components as being similar to our controller helped me to keep things a bit more organized in my mind today. Connecting the different components to their parents to make sure things are communicating properly is tricky and I am struggling with this part, especially props.
