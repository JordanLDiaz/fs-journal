## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
In C#, inheritance is a mechanism that lets developers describe a relationship between two classes, the derived (child) class and the base (parent) class. The derived class inherits from the base class, allowing us to separate out data in a way that gives us more control over what the user has access to. 

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
In C#, not all members of a class are inherited. Constructors are not inheritable and child classes don't inherit finalizers from their parents.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?
Accessibility affects inheritance because whether something is visible or not depends on its accessibility. If a class is marked private, internal, or protected, it can affect inheritance. Private members aren't visible from child classes, protected members are visible only in child classes, and internal members are visible in derived classes located in the same assembly as the parent class.
