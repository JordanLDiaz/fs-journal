## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I have really enjoyed my time in this course, I just wish it was longer! Coming from absolutely no coding experience, and minimal tech experience, it has definitely been a huge learning curve for me, but thinking back to where I started, I am very happy with how far I've come and the projects I've created. This course really has opened up a whole new world for me and I'm excited to continue learning and creating. With that being said, I am definitely hard on myself and I have had some major struggles with impostor syndrome and doubting my abilities. I wish I felt more confident and comfortable with all of the topics we've covered, and I feel that I'm still getting a handle on the logic of coding in general. I have enjoyed most of my struggles, but there have definitely been times where I haven't due to the above reasons. My confidence and belief in myself is something I'm working on in general.

For the final, my plan is to really analyze the project/requirements/figma before jumping into any actual coding. I plan to make a list of tasks that I'll need to complete to help me stay organized. I'll use this to help me timebox throughout, but will also do my best to stay flexible in my thinking so that I limit the amount of stress/overwhelm I cause myself. I also want to make a list of access control ideas so that those are easier to implement as I go through the front-end. I plan to be more intentional with my breaks, something I've definitely struggled with. I am definitely going to put in a lot of time this weekend, especially on the backend, so that I can maximize my time next week on the front end. I also plan to be better about not overstyling as I go so that I am focusing more on functionality first. This will help my time management, and allow me to hopefully breathe and just be able to focus on styling on the last day. Fingers crossed!
