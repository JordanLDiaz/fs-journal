## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`?
A primary key is a unique identifier for a value in a table that cannot be null, while a foreign key is used to reference data from a different table and helps to create a relationship between those tables. In order to create those relationships, you would use the primary key from one table as a foreign key in another, thus establishing the relationship. When using foreign keys, you must reference the table the key comes from. 

2. What is an `Alias`?
An alias is like a nickname or abbreviated name for something you are referencing. We use aliases when reassigning values, such as in our SQL requests. 

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```
SELECT
d.*,
FROM doctors d
JOIN patients p
