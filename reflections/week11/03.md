Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
I think the looming final has caused me to put a lot of pressure on getting All Spice as complete as possible to use as a reference, which caused me to get overwhelmed when encountering bugs. I made the mistake of moving on from incomplete functions and started jumping around too much in the process. This caused me to get lost in my code and when I went back to work on those incomplete processes, I forgot my train of thought/started way overthinking things. I just need to remember to take things one at a time and BREATHE!
