## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
Value type - The variables within this data type directly hold values within its memory space. These include our typical variables we use such as int, bool, varchar, enum, etc. As these variables are passed between methods, changes in one method won't affect the others. 
Reference type - Does not store its value directly, but stores the address where the value is stored (e.g. the pointer to another memory location). These include string, arrays, classes, etc. Changes to variables that are passed between methods here will be reflected in the calling methods. 
Pointer type - 

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?
Value data types include bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort. There are far fewer data types in javascript. C# has multiple for numbers (int, decimal, double, float), and quite a few that I have not learned about yet. 

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
Reference types get stored in memory by storing the address where the value of the data type is being stored, rather than the actual data value itself. With value types, the actual value itself is stored.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
C# seemed very scary/different to start, but by the end of lab it was starting to click decently. Setup on a new language/program is tricky at times due to worry about setting it up incorrectly which could cause me issues later on down the road. I learned how to use Guid for Ids and how to create an Enum folder in order to use enums with C#.
