## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
Enums are unique data types that let you assign symbolic names to values. Since they are strongly typed constraints, enums of one type cannot be assigned to an enum of another type. You might use an enum when putting icons in a MessageBox or when using a set of related numbers in a program. 

2. How can you modify an Enum?
You can modify an Enum by changing the base type and member values. Base types include byte, sbyte, ushort, int, uint, long, and ulong.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could).
I used an Enum on Monday when doing the choreScore project so a user could select the priority level of the chore. I had to make an entirely separate folder for enums with a Priority.cs file, then I linked this file to my model so that I could use the enum in my database.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Today we started our 0 point checkpoint using vue and c#. Starting from scratch/setup on this felt easier than previous projects. Today I focused on getting my backend functions written and passing the preset postman tests. I made a few errors when creating my sql tables, but was able to easily correct them by dropping columns/adding new columns and by using alter table.
