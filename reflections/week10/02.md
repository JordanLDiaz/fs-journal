## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?
A List in C# is a generic type that can be used to create a list of any data type (e.g. reference or value types).

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
I think I'll use List.Add, List.Find, List.FindAll, List.Insert, List.Remove, List.Sort often. These seem the most similar to methods we commonly use in class/on projects. 

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
You could use List.Find or List.FindLast.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Don't forget to add your transients to the startup file or else requests will not go through on postman or swagger. SQL is very interesting and seems relatively straight forward, at least with what we have done so far. I look forward to using it more!
