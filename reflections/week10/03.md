## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
Information in a row is a complete object (like a single chore, job, house, car, etc), while a column is a single property that belongs to that object (e.g. name, description, time, location, etc).

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
CREATE TABLE characters(
  id INT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
  age VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR(255),
);


3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
DELETE FROM removes a row in a table, while DROP TABLE removes the entire table.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
Today we learned how to join SQL tables in order to populate account data onto our album data which was very cool! Including authorizations in C# shares some similarities to how we did it with node, but definitely looks very different and will take some getting use to.
