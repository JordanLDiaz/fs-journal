## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
My favorite tip that is most beneficial to improving my design is vertical offset with box-shadows to add depth and realism to the features on my page. Strategicly done shadows can look realistic for the viewer and is a great way to give your page depth. I also really liked the idea of adding more space between elements on the page instead of just adding more borders because it will make the page look less cluttered and busy, but still creates clear distinction between things. 

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
Good design influences people when visiting a website by drawing their eyes immediately to the most important content on the page. Being intentional with font colors and weights, rather than just size, is a good way to draw the viewer's eyes to key information that will make them more likely to interact with the page. Keeping your page uncluttered and cohesive is also more appealing to the eye. If there's too much on a page and/or colors aren't cohesive, the eye doesn't know where to look, and the viewer is less likely to interact.

Some things you could convey through design alone are emphasizing certain buttons on a page based on their level of importance/function and identifying when a certain item on a page is actively being viewed. Ultimately I think a well-designed website is going to be taken more seriously and will hopefully prevent a user from immediately exiting out.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
My big takeaway today is that Bootstrap is a life saver! So many of the issues I had yesterday while trying to format in CSS were quickly solved with Bootstrap and made it easier to get the building blocks down with a solid layout/structure. The hardest part about today was knowing what I wanted to do to further design out the website, but struggling to find the correct classes that would accomplish what I wanted. There are so many built in classes, which is super helpful, but the amount is definitely overwhelming and it was a challenge to keep things straight in my mind. I know that the more and more I practice, I will feel more comfortable with all the options and it will start to come more easily.
