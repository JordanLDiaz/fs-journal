# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

The ideas I really want to take away from this week are that it's important not to jump right into building out my code from the get go. Since it's the first week, I was so excited to get building and creating, that I didn't allow myself as much time completing wireframes as I should have. Because of this, I struggled with the basic layout of my clones at times and got lost in all of the little details that should have been saved for later. In the future, I am going to take my time more and remind myself that a solid wireframe, even a low-fidelity one, will help me process through my code so much better than just jumping right into coding.
