## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?
We use Git for a few reasons. Primarily Git is used as a way to track changes to code as you're workig on a project. Committing and pushing code consistently while working on project allows you to track the changes you make, which makes it easy go back and see exact times and dates when changes were made. Git also has both local and remote repositories so that your files are saved not only on your computer, but also remotely. This allows multiple developers to work on the same files simulataneously and to see any changes relatively quickly after they are committed/pushed. 

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
Having multiple branches is beneficial because it allows you to track all of the commits you've pushed, which is helpful when needing to revisit previous versions of your code. Using a test branch allows you to make changes to your code without affecting your main branch. Eventually you can merge your test and main branches once you're happy with your code!

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub
The main difference between Git and GitHub is that Git is your local repository, while GitHub is your remote repository. Any changes you make to your code and save will only show on your local Git repository, whereas your changes will only show on the remote repository once you commit and push your code to GitHub. From the remote repository on GitHub, you can also pull commits to your local repository and you can clone others' repositories.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
One takeaway from today's assignment is that not all commits need to go to the main branch and instead can be done on a test branch. This makes me feel less nervous about committing changes and possibly ruining my code. I also learned that you can easily see exactly when commits occurred, which could be helpful in the future with employment, or just so you can communicate when changes have been made with others.
