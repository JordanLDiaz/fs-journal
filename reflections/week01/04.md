## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
The purpose of wireframing is to plan and map out the components and information and features that will be on a screen. It is typically the first phase of planning out a website/product. It includes making decisions about the organization of the screen, spacing, and functionality. It really focuses on the most important components of the web design, rather than on the styling, and intentionally limits all of the little details in order to keep it intuitively user-focused first. 

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
There are a few different levels of detail to consider when choosing the type of wire-frame you want to complete. These include low-fidelity, mid-fidelity, and high-fidelity wireframes. 

The first level, low-fidelity wireframes, is the most simple and requires just pen and paper or a whiteboard. I like the idea of starting with a simple hand-written wire-frame because it prevents you from getting to bogged down in detail. I know I would get caught up in the positioning of things if I were to go straight to a digital wire-frame.

The next level of wireframe is mid-fidelity, which is a digitial wire-frame that may require some kind of software, like Sketch or Baslamiq. This type of wireframe does require making decisions about more of the details like spacing and functionality, but still doesn't add styling and images. Digital wire-framing is beneficial because it allows you to keep a record of the progress on your project, document decisions you make as you progress, and to easily share with others that you may be working with on the project.

The last level is high-fidelity wireframes. These take the mid-fidelity wireframes and kick it up a notch by including details such as the actual images and text that will appear on the final produect. This is also where designers/developers explore more complex functionalities. 

Working through each level of wireframing is immensely helpful for your final product because by the time you're ready to start truly coding the program, all of the design and functionality decisions have already been made. 
Even though the process may be long, this helps to save time and money in the long run.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
I think wire frames are definitely worth the time, energy, and effort because it's important to have a complete vision of what you want the end result to look like. I also think it's beneficial because it doesn't focus on the styling/images that will be on the page, and really helps to make sure that the page is laid out in a functional, easy to navigate way for the user. Personally, I want to always prioritize wire framing because if I don't, I find that my mind wants to worry too much about the styling elements which gets in the way of the basic structure of the page.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
My main takeaway from today's assignment is that creating a wireframe prior to starting to code is really valuable. Due to being out of town, I just did a quick low-fidelity wireframe with pen and paper, but I am looking forward to using Figma to make mid- and high- fidelity wireframes in the future. Doing this really helps me to slow down my brain and focus on each component at a time, carefully thinking through each component and identifying places where I need to do more nesting of these elements to get the look just right. I am not truly happy with my clone because of limited time from being out of town and the need to work on Checkpoint 1, so I wasn't able to get everything quite like I wanted. Overall the structure is there though and it is a good foundation. I am interested in figuring out how to create a carousal, but I knew I wouldn't have the time to quite figure that out. I also need to figure out how to get the phone component split between two separate rows. I am disappointed that I wasn't able to work with a partner on the clone because I know that would have been a very valuable experience to see how others are thinking through their wireframes and their code. I am really looking forward to future opportunities to do so!

From the reading assignment, I want to make sure I always keep in mind the most important parts of a wireframe so that I don't get bogged down in all the details. This includes spacing, layout, and information hierarchy. I also want to make sure that I am constantly thinking about user navigation and making it user friendly.
