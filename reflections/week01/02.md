## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
A Pseudo-Class is a type of selector used when you want to treat an element differently in certain situations. For example, if you want a button to change color when hovered over, you would use the pseudo-class :hover attached to the respective element. Other pseudo classes I think will be commonly used are :disabled, :link, :visited, and :active.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
Specificity is essentially a way to place varying levels of importance on the CSS that has been applied to your elements, especially when the same elements have multiple rules being applied to them. Elements with a simple tagName have the lowest specificity (1), while elements with a class attached have a specificity of 10, and elements with an id attached have a specificity of 100. I can use specificity to target specific elements where I want to override previously set specificity, without affecting the CSS rules for elements with lower specificity.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
If you overused the !important feature, you could accidentally override prior levels of specificity that you've set. I think overall it would make your code harder to manage and more difficult to identify/fix bugs that may occur.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
I feel like I went into today's assignment thinking it would be relatively straightforward (whooo dunning-kruger effect!), and while I definitely started off strong, things became increasingly messier and more difficult to debug. There were several instances where I realized I no longer had a need for certain selectors and was able to do some refactoring, which made me feel great! BUT as my code grew, I found my mind jumping around a lot and not quite following through with one task before getting distracted by another. I wish that I had taken more time in the beginning to really process through the mock and break things down more carefully before even starting to code. Another thing I am really going to need to work on is letting go of my need for things to be "perfect" before moving on. It kept me stuck a lot more today than it needed to!
